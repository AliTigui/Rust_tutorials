     * scope is where variable is valide to use when variable get out of scope it get droped 
     * integer char literal-string array boolean and tupple are craeted in the stack
     * complex type like String use head and those type of variables apply ownership rules
     * when we assign variable that are stored in heap to another one the new one become owner and old become invalide to use
     * passing those complex variables to function make function parameter take ownership of them
     * function don't take ownership of simple variables like integer boolean ...
     * to fix ownership problems we use reference
     * reference is like making pointer to variables in the heap
     * Reference rule :
       - At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
       - References must always be valid.
     * to change value of referenced variable we have to create it mutable also it reference mutable
     * slice is reference to part of colection we can use it with string array
     * string slice is of type &str
     * array slice it of type &[i32] or &[f32]
